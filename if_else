int main()
{
    int x=3,y=5;
    if(x==3)
    {
        cout<<"OK";
    }
    else;
    {
        cout<<"Forget it.";
    }
    return 0;
}
//Output: OKForget it.
Because if condition will work perfectly but else condition is terminated and block after else is independent
therefore it will print 'Forget it.' as output.
